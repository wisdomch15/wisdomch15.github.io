# Packet Sniffing and Analysis

TOOLS USED\
Wireshark\
VirtualBox\

INTRODUCTION\
In this lab, I used Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. The goal was to identify protocols, inspect packets and detect suspicious activity.

STEPS\

Step 1:\
I launched Wireshark on VirtualBox and selected the 'eth0' interface for packet capture.

Step 2:\
I started capturing and generated some HTTP traffic by visiting 'http://testphp.vulnweb.com'.
