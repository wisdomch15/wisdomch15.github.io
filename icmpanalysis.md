# ICMP Analysis

TOOLS USED

Wireshark\
VirtualBox\
Kali Linux

INTRODUCTION

In this lab, I used Wireshark to analyze ICMP traffic generated by the `ping` command.  
ICMP is primarily used for diagnostic and error-reporting purposes, such as testing connectivity and measuring round-trip time between hosts.  

STEPS

Step 1:  
I launched Wireshark on VirtualBox and selected the `eth0` interface for packet capture.

Step 2: 
I generated ICMP traffic by pinging the ip address `8.8.8.8`.  

Step 3:
I applied the filter icmp to only show ICMP traffic.


Step 4: ICMP Request and Reply Analysis

Packet 1: ICMP Echo Request (Client → Server)
Source: 192.168.1.10 (Client)
Destination: 142.250.190.14 (Google)
Type: 8 (Echo Request)
Code: 0
Identifier (ID): 0x1c4d
Sequence Number: 1
Info: The client is requesting a response to test connectivity.

Packet 2: ICMP Echo Reply (Server → Client)
Source: 142.250.190.14 (Google)
Destination: 192.168.1.10 (Client)
Type: 0 (Echo Reply)
Code: 0
Identifier (ID): 0x1c4d (matches request)
Sequence Number: 1 (matches request)
Info: The server replies, confirming connectivity.
