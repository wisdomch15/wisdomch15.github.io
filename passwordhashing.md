# Password Hashing & Cracking 

##  Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Hashcat
- Wordlists (`rockyou.txt` and custom lists)

##  Introduction
In this lab, I explored how password hashing and cracking works using Hashcat   
The objective was to:
- Generate hashes using weak and strong passwords (MD5, SHA-256).
- Attempt to crack them using dictionary attacks
- Compare the resilience of weak vs strong passwords.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Setup
Created a working directory for the lab:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir hashlab && cd hashlab
```

Created a password list with both weak and strong passwords:

```bash
cat > passwords.txt <<'EOF'
123456
password
letmein
password123
P@ssw0rd!
S3cureP@55w0rd2025!
correcthorsebatterystaple
EOF
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Generate Hashes

### MD5 Hashes
```bash
while read -r pw; do
  echo -n "$pw" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'
done < passwords.txt > hashes_md5.txt
```

### SHA-256 Hashes
```bash
while read -r pw; do
  echo -n "$pw" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'
done < passwords.txt > hashes_sha256.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Crack Hashes with Hashcat

### MD5 Example
```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes_md5.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
hashcat --show -m 0 hashes_md5.txt
```

### SHA-256 Example
```bash
hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 hashes_sha256.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
hashcat --show -m 1400 hashes_sha256.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Crack Hashes with John the Ripper

### MD5 Example
```bash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes_md5.txt
john --show --format=raw-md5 hashes_md5.txt
```

### SHA-256 Example
```bash
john --format=raw-sha256 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes_sha256.txt
john --show --format=raw-sha256 hashes_sha256.txt
```

## üì∏ Step 5: Screenshots

(Add screenshots here showing successful cracks and failed attempts)

Example:
- Screenshot 1: Hashcat cracking weak MD5 password.
- Screenshot 2: John the Ripper cracking SHA-256 weak password.
- Screenshot 3: Attempt on strong password showing "Exhausted" (not cracked).

## FINDINGS

- **Weak passwords** (`123456`, `password`, `letmein`, `password123`) were cracked easily using `rockyou.txt`.  
- **Strong passwords** (`S3cureP@55w0rd2025!`, `correcthorsebatterystaple`) resisted cracking within reasonable time.  
- Hash type matters:
  - **MD5** is very fast and easily brute-forced.
  - **SHA-256** is stronger but still crackable with weak inputs if unsalted.
- The best defense is:
  - Use **long, complex, unique passwords**.
  - Store them with **slow, salted hashing algorithms** (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

## CONCLUSION
Weak passwords were cracked instantly with a dictionary attack, while strong ones resisted both dictionary and brute-force attempts. MD5 and SHA-256 without salting are insecure for password storage. Strong, unique passwords combined with modern hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2) provide far better security.
