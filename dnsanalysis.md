# DNS Analysis

TOOLS USED

Wireshark\
VirtualBox\
Kali Linux

INTRODUCTION

In this lab, I used Wireshark to capture and analyze DNS traffic.  
The goal was to understand how a client resolves a domain name into an IP address.

STEPS

Step 1:\
I launched Wireshark on VirtualBox and selected the `eth0` interface for packet capture.\

Step 2:\
I generated DNS traffic by visiting `http://example.com` in Firefox.\

Step 3:\
I applied the filter `dns` to only show DNS traffic.\

Step 4:\
I examined a DNS query packet sent by the client.\
Client Request:  
- Transaction ID: 0x1234  
- Flags: Standard query  
- Query: testphp.vulnweb.com  
- Type: A (IPv4 host address)  
- Class: IN (Internet)

Step 5:\
I examined the DNS response from the server.\
Server Response:  
- Transaction ID: 0x1234 (matches query)  
- Flags: Standard query response, no error  
- Answer: testphp.vulnweb.com â†’ 192.168.1.50

FINDINGS

- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.  
- Queries and responses can be observed clearly in plaintext.  
- Attackers could spoof DNS responses if no protection (e.g., DNSSEC) is in place.  

CONCLUSION

This lab demonstrated the **basic DNS resolution process** using Wireshark.  
I learned how to capture queries, analyze responses, and understand the role of DNS in network communication.
